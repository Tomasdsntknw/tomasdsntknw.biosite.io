        <p>Jordan has a strong love for reading, visiting the dog park, and sleeping!
        <br>
        <br>Jordan started reading in fall of 2021. She informed me that she has a good friend who is a huge book nerd that got her started. In Jordan's words,
"I use to read a ton in high school so it's nice to see that hobby come back. When I'm not reading, I do love visiting the dog park with my boys.
It brings me great joy to see my dogs running around a big yard and playing with each other. Sleeping is always a favorite since I work 2 jobs and sometimes I have to work 18 - hour days." - Jordan

        <br>In her words, "I got a Cricut for Christmas so I've been playing with it and making shirts, cups, and wedding decor etc. 
I wanted to design custom cups and shirts for vacations. It's very time consuming but the outcomes are always awesome." -Jordan
